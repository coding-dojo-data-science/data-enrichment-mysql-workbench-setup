			<h2>Objectives:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Understand how using MySQL differs from spreadsheets</li>
				<li>Understand the importance of SQL in the work of a data professional</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Many students are familiar with storing data in a spreadsheet such as Excel or Google Sheets.&nbsp;
				&nbsp;However, as the size and complexity of data grow, the spreadsheet as a tool for data storage
				begins to show a number of limitations. These include:<br></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Limited amount of data storage</li>
				<li>Must work on an area of sheet that you can ‘see’</li>
				<li>Difficult to share</li>
				<li>Easy to create a ‘mess’ with formulas referenced across many sheets</li>
				<li>Limited security of sensitive information</li>
			</ul>
			<p>From a data management standpoint, spreadsheets (and raw text files) are not adequate. This shortcoming
				demonstrates the usefulness of a centrally managed system. Such a system is known as
				a&nbsp;database.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Databases</strong> are typically deployed as servers in a client/server setting. Many
				applications (clients) interact with it for various reasons.</p>
			<p><br></p>

			<p><br></p>
			<p>Most databases exist, not for analytics, but to provide support to applications and processes. The data
				is used to ‘keep state’ in applications. This means that the data is the memory of an organization.</p>
			<p>However, with analytics and data science, the database represents an opportunity to extract insight while
				maintaining integrity. In most cases, the data analyst/data scientist does not set up the database. It
				already exists as part of the organization and/or product. However, it is critical for all data
				professionals to understand the fundamentals of how a database works and to interact with databases in
				order to answer questions of interest.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>There are several different types of databases. The most common types include;</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Relational Databases</strong>:&nbsp;Highly structured sets of flat tables that are "related"
					to each other through the use of keys</li>
				<li><strong>NoSQL Databases</strong>: Flexible databases with no set schema or relationships</li>
				<li><strong>Big Data Databases</strong>:&nbsp;Large scale storage systems that operate across a set of
					servers or ‘cluster’</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For each of these types of databases, the most common way to interact with them is through the use of a
				‘client’ using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Almost all production databases will use SQL as the
				language of choice when dealing with a database. Sometimes databases have their own unique language.
				However, it is almost always a variation on traditional SQL. This makes the language a key skill for
				anyone in the data workforce. Often business value can be created just by being an expert at SQL.</p>
			<p>Our course will focus on relational databases, and specifically employ MySQL server. We will also take
				advantage of the MySQL Workbench.&nbsp; To get started, you will need to follow the installation
				instructions appropriate for your operating system in the next module.</p>
