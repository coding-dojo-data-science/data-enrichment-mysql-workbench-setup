	<h3>Queries</h3>
	<p>1. What query would you run to get all the customers inside city_id = 312? Your query should return the customers' first name, last name, email, address, and city.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>2.&nbsp;What query would you run to get all comedy films? Note that the genre is called the category in this schema.&nbsp; Your query should return film title, description, release year, rating, and special features.</p>
	<p>3. What query would you run to get all the films that Johnny Lollobrigida was in? Your query should return the actor's last name, film title, and release year.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>4. What query would you run to get the first and last names of all the actors in the movie titled "Bingo Talented"?</p>
	<p>5. What query would you run to get the customer_id associated with all payments greater than twice the average payment amount? (HINT: use 2* in your query to get twice the amount). Your result should include the customer id and the amount.</p>
	<p>6. What query would you run to list the first and last names of the 5 customers who have the highest number(count) of payments? You can title the number of payments as num_payments.
	</p>
	<p><br></p><p>After performing all of your queries and displaying the answers to each question, save your notebook, commit the change to your repository and submit the repository URL for this assignment.</p>
